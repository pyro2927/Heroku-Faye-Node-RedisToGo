# faye-redis [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-redis-node.png)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-redis-node)

This plugin provides a Redis-based backend for the
[Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) messaging server. It allows a single Faye
service to be distributed across many front-end web servers by storing state and
routing messages through a [Redis](http://redis.io) database server.


## Usage

Pass in the engine and any settings you need when setting up your Faye server.

```js
var faye  = require('faye'),
    redis = require('faye-redis'),
    http  = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

var bayeux = new faye.NodeAdapter({
  mount:    '/',
  timeout:  25,
  engine: {
    type:   redis,
    host:   'redis.example.com',
    // more options
  }
});

bayeux.attach(server);
server.listen(8000);
```

The full list of settings is as follows.

* <b>`host`</b> - hostname of your Redis instance
* <b>`port`</b> - port number, default is `6379`
* <b>`password`</b> - password, if `requirepass` is set
* <b>`database`</b> - number of database to use, default is `0`
* <b>`namespace`</b> - prefix applied to all keys, default is `''`
* <b>`socket`</b> - path to Unix socket if `unixsocket` is set
